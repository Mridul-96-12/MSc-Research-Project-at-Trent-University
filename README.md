# Real-time Fake news detection with Machine learning
This report presents the methodology and findings of a project aimed at developing a machine learning-based system for the detection of fake news. The project involves the implementation of four text-based machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest classifiers. The objective is to assess the authenticity of real-time news articles by analyzing their textual content.
